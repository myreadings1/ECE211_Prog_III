### Sample Questions About C

This document shows some basic exercises in C programming language.
Using C code, write a program that:
1- Finds number of occurrence of a letter in a given string.
Example: Occurrence of the letter ‘a’ in the string “Hassan Ali”. Output 2

2- Finds a pattern in a given string.
Example: Pattern “Ali” in the string “Hassan Ali”. Output: pattern is found at index 7.

3- Finds max number in an array of integers.
Example: The array [2,6,7,2,0,9]. Output: Max is 9

4- Reverses the order of a given array.
Example: The array [2,6,7,2,0,9]. Output [9,0,2,7,6,2]

5- Calculates total of a given array of integers.
Example: The array [2,6,7,2,0,9]. Output: 26

6- Prints a pyramid of “*”, where the based length is selected by the user.
Example: the program shows: Enter the length of the base: user enters 4
The program outputs:

- '*'
- '* *'
- * * *
- * * * *


7- Sort a given array.
Example: [2,6,7,0,9]. Output: [0,2,6,7,9]
