This document shows some basic exercises in C programming language.
Using C code, write a program that:
1- Finds number of occurrence of a letter in a given string.
Example: Occurrence of the letter ‘a’ in the string “Hassan Ali”. Output 2

2- Finds a pattern in a given string.
Example: Pattern “Ali” in the string “Hassan Ali”. Output: pattern is found at index 7.

3- Finds max number in an array of integers.
Example: The array [2,6,7,2,0,9]. Output: Max is 9

4- Reverses the order of a given array.
Example: The array [2,6,7,2,0,9]. Output [9,0,2,7,6,2]

5- Calculates total of a given array of integers.
Example: The array [2,6,7,2,0,9]. Output: 26

6- Prints a pyramid of “*”, where the based length is selected by the user.
Example: the program shows: Enter the length of the base: user enters 4
The program outputs:

 '*'
 
 '* *'
 
 '* * *'
 
 '* * * *'


7- Sorts a given array.
Example: [2,6,7,0,9]. Output: [0,2,6,7,9]

8- Calculates Fibonacci sequence.

9- Finds GCD For Two Numbers in C.

Q1: Circle all suitable answers: (25 Marks)

(A) For a write operation, computer’s CPU sends to the memory:
(1) Index of the for loop (i and j). (2) Address and (W/R) signal. (3) Data, address, and
(W/R) signal. (4) None of the above.

(B) For a read operation, computer CPU sends to the memory:
(1) Index of the for loop (i and j). (2) Address and (W/R) signal. (3) Data, address, and
(W/R) signal. (4) None of the above.

(C) At the execution time, the CPU usually accesses the instruction memory for read and
write operations. (True or False)

(D) A do-while loop may execute non or more C statements. (True or False)

(E) Did you try to manipulate characters as integers in C? What was the results?
(1) Index of the for loop (i and j). (2) Address and (W/R) signal. (3) Data, address, and
(W/R) signal. (4) None of the above.

Q2: (25 Marks)

Write a C code program that accepts a sentence from a user and calculates number of capital
and small letters. Note the following ASCII codes: A=65, Z=90, a=97, z=122.

Q3: (25 Marks)

Fibonacci sequence is defined as: Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F0 = 0 and F1 = 1. Write a C
code program that: (1) accepts user’s input as n and calculate the Fibonacci sequence; and
(2) accepts user’s input as k and outputs the closet n. Example: F9=34, F10=55, if user
input is k=50, then the program outputs n = 10 because 50 is closer to F10 =55 than F9=
34.

Q4: (25 Marks) Write a C code program that calculates sum of a given array of doubles.
